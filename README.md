## Introduction

Next.js is a popular React framework that enables the development of server-rendered React applications with ease. This project serves as a starting point for those who want to learn Next.js through the tutorial mentioned above.

## Installation

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```
   cd nextjs-tutorial-project
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:
   ```
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

## Usage

After completing the installation steps, you can start the project by running the following command:

```bash
npm run start-graf && npm run dev
# or
yarn start-graf && yarn dev
```

This will execute both commands sequentially. The first command, `npm run start-graf`, is responsible for some initial setup or configurations, and the second command, `npm run dev`, will start the development server for your Next.js project.

You can then access the application by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.
